This program will be a simple C program that takes in two arguments.
The first argument will be a base 10 number. The second will be a 
base between 2-16 or 64. It will convert this base 10 number to the
selected base a print the output.

Compiling gave me a little bit of trouble before I figured out that
you need to use -lm at the end to compile with the math library. I 
used the math library to get log(x) to work for my mask/shift algorithm.
